          To install OBS, refer to the installation instructions for Linux which
          can be found
          <a
            href="https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions#linux"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. It can either be installed through the PPA (Ubuntu-based only) or
          as a Flatpak. FFMPEG is necessary to run OBS on Linux. It will be
          installed at the same time as OBS if you follow the instructions from
          the website.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes OBS a fantastic streaming application is its' modularity
          through Plugins. At this point, some plugins are installed by default
          on Linux (such as Browser source), but here is a short list of some I
          like to add.
        </p>

        <p>
          Installation for this plugin is as simple as downloading it from the
          Releases section and drag & drop in the
          <code>~/.config/obs-studio/plugins</code>
          directory. Make sure you place the entire folder in there, and not
          just the files. Restart OBS, and it should load on startup.

          OBS is an powerful streaming application which can encode a wide range
          of resolutions and bitrates without using too much CPU power if you
          have the right hardware. In my case, my PC is approximately 5-6 years
          old with a Nvidia GTX 980 and an Intel i7 5930K. I can stream at 1080p
          30 FPS depending on the game, but 720p30/60FPS is much more
          comfortable. Here are the settings I use:
        </p>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Toggle <code>Automatically record when streaming</code> ON.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stream</h3>
        <p>
          OBS allows the user to stream to a wide variety of services, including
          Twitch, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Restream and more! Depending on
          the service you choose, you can also log in in OBS to retrieve some of
          the Docks for that service (I know this is the case for Twitch at
          least).
        </p>
        <p>
          For myself, I usually stream on Twitch. Log in, then select the server
          of your choice (usually the one closest to you), or leave it on
          Automatic. I usually enable the Twitch Chat Add-ons, as they're quite
          popular nowadays.
        </p>
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Output Mode to Advanced.</li>
          <li>
            Audio Track to 1, and Twitch VOD track to 2. This allows the Twitch
            VODs to cut out Copyrighted music from the livestreams.
          </li>
          <li>Rate Control to CBR (Constant BitRate).</li>
          <li>
            Video Bitrate to about 1/3 of your upload, or to the recommended
            bitrate for the resolution you're planning to stream at. If you're
            wondering what the recommended bitrate is,
            <a href="https://stream.twitch.tv/encoding/" target="_blank"
              >check this website from Twitch</a
            >. In my case, it's about 4500 Kbps.
          </li>
          <li>Leave Keyframe Intervals at 0, or increase to 2.</li>
          <li>Preset to <code>Quality</code>.</li>
          <li>Profile to <code>High</code>.</li>
          <li>GPU to 0.</li>
          <li>Max B-frames to 2.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sample Rate to 48 kHz.</li>
          <li>Channels to Stereo.</li>
          <li>
            If you followed the instructions on how to set up
            <a
              href="https://github.com/GabrielMontplaisir/notes/blob/main/POP_OS.md#pipewire"
              target="_blank"
              >Pipewire</a
            >, then you can set the Desktop Audio to
            <code>pipe_sink, WebMusic_OUT</code>, and the Mic to your selected
            microphone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Video</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Base Resolution to the resolution on your main monitor. In my case,
            it's 1920x1080.
          </li>
          <li>
            Output Resolution to 1280x720, or whatever you'll be streaming at.
            If you're streaming at 1080p, then leave at the original resolution
          </li>
          <li>Downscale Filter to <code>Bicubic</code>.</li>
          <li>FPS to 30 or 60.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hotkeys</h3>
        <p>
          I'm not going to share my hotkeys as this can change per person and
          per setup. However, it's a good idea to set some hotkeys to hide/show
          your overlay, to (un)mute your microphone and music, and some more
          hotkeys to change scenes.
        </p>
        <h3>Advanced</h3>
        <li>Color Format to NV12.</li>
        <li>Color Space to 709.</li>
        <li>Color Range to Full.</li>
        <li>
          I do not recommend using a Stream Delay as this can impact your
          experience to communicate with your chat.
        </li>
        <li>Automatic Reconnect Enabled to 10s and 20 retries.</li>

          The Linux version of OBS differs in some ways to the Windows version.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding Sinks</h3>
        <p>
          If you're like me and use Voicemeeter Banana on Windows, then you
          might realise that you can't simply use the Cable Output as a
          "microphone" in the Linux version. In fact, it's almost always
          preferable to add the device you want as a Source in OBS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you followed the instructions for
          <a
            href="https://github.com/GabrielMontplaisir/notes/blob/main/POP_OS.md#pipewire"
            target="_blank"
            >Pipewire</a
          >, then add Discord as a Source in your scenes and set it as
          Discord_OUT so your viewers can listen to the conversation on Discord.
          It's always a good idea to set a hotkey to (un)mute your Discord
          conversation.

          <h2>Alerts</h2>

            data-clipboard-text="https://gabrielmontplaisir.com/freeCodeCamp/tech-docs-page/#alerts"

        <strong>TODO: Create Streamelements.md</strong>
        <p>
          For Alerts, the two major services who offer alerts for donations,
          subscriptions, hosts, follows, etc. are
          <a href="https://streamlabs.com/" target="_blank">Streamlabs</a> &
          <a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank"
            >StreamElements</a
          >. I personally use StreamElements, but the choice is ultimately
          yours. Streamlabs is more "feature-rich" and have their own version of
          OBS which integrates with their own features if you prefer (albeit a
          little bloated for my taste).
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, pick one of the services and sign-in to your Twitch account.
          Then, set up your alerts as you desire.
        </p>
        <h3>Triggerfyre</h3>
        <p>
          A fun type of alert which uses the Twitch Channel Points system to
          make audible rewards. Simply add the sound effect of your choice, and
          link it to the Channel Point reward of your choice. Then, add a
          Browser Source in OBS to Triggerfyre so people can hear the sound
          effect when they redeem a Channel Point reward.

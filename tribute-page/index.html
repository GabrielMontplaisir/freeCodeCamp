            "Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near
            or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is the most
            awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to
            be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the
            right time, historically, where this invention has taken form."
